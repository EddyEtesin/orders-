# Order Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive exploratory and analytical study of an **Order dataset** containing **9,994 order records** across **21 attributes**. The dataset provides rich transactional data encompassing product details, customer information, sales figures, profit metrics, regional data, and timestamps related to order and shipping events.

---

## Objective

The main goal is to extract actionable insights that inform business decisions related to sales performance, customer behavior, regional trends, shipping efficiency, and operational metrics using **Pandas** and data visualization libraries in Python.

## Dataset Structure

* **Number of records:** 9,994
* **Number of columns:** 21
* Columns include: `Order ID`, `Product Name`, `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `Sales`, `Profit`, `Discount`, `Quantity`, `Customer Name`, `Segment`, `Region`, `City`, `State`, `Order Date`, `Ship Date`, `Shipping Mode`, `Manufacturer`, among others.

## Key Analytical Questions

### General Overview

* How many unique products and customers exist?
* What are the most frequently purchased products?
* How are orders distributed by category and sub-category?

### Sales & Profit Analysis

* What are the total sales and profit figures?
* Which products generate the most and least profit?
* Are there products generating negative profit (loss)?
* What is the average profit margin by category?

### Customer Insights

* Which customers generate the highest revenue?
* Which customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) contributes the most sales?
* Are there frequent customers with low profit contributions?

### Regional Performance

* What are the top-performing states and cities in terms of sales?
* Which region shows the highest average sales per order?
* Which manufacturers dominate specific regions?

### Time-Based Trends

* What are the monthly and yearly sales trends?
* How does profit vary by month or season?
* Which months have the highest order volumes?

### Shipping Analysis

* What are the most common shipping modes?
* How does shipping time differ across regions?
* Are there delays between order and ship dates?

### Operational Metrics

* Which sub-categories have the highest number of orders?
* Are there correlations between discount, quantity, and profit?
* Does offering a high discount increase sales or reduce profit?

### Advanced/Custom Analysis

* What is the relationship between quantity ordered and sales/profit?
* Which products have high sales but low profit margins?
* Is there a correlation between sales and profit ratio?

## Technologies Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

## How to Use

1. Load the dataset (`order.csv`) into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing (convert dates, handle missing values).
3. Apply grouping, aggregation, and filtering operations to answer the key questions.
4. Visualize trends and distributions to gain insights.
5. Interpret results to guide strategic business decisions.

## Conclusion

This analysis enables stakeholders to better understand sales dynamics, customer purchasing patterns, regional strengths, and operational bottlenecks. It highlights opportunities to optimize pricing strategies, improve shipping efficiency, and focus on high-impact products and customers to drive profitability.
